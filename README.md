### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So, if you are looking at my profile I guess you want to know something about me...

I'm a specialist in the areas of agile and devops. While the theories/practices are tool and platfrom agnostic I have spent considerable time with tools and platforms as well. Azure DevOps and GitHub are my favourites but far from the only ones. Occasionally I hold courses. Typically Scrum Master courses and Azure Boards classes. 

Background... I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science, started my career as a fullstack developer on the .Net platform and progressed to project manager and product owner before ending up as an agile/devops specialist. While I can still read and understand code in many languages I really dont write code any more except a few powershell scripts from time to time. 

If you want more info I'd suggest you look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesperfernstrom) which should be fairly up to date.
